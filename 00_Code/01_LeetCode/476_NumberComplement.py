# #Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
# #The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
# #Note:
# #The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# #You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

# #Your runtime beats 53.61 % of python submissions.
